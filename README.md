## üî® Build Project
To generate the pdf file for this project run:
```sh
make
```
After this a new directory called `build` containing the auxilliary files will be created and it contains the pdf file.

To clean the generated files just run:
```sh
make clean
```
> **Note**
>
> Please make sure you have `make` install on your system. if not you can run any of the following commands
>```
sudo apt install make
