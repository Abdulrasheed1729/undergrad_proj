    \section{General Introduction}
    The history of Robotics can be traced as far back to 420 B.C., which started with the invention of a wooden, steam-propelled bird by Arcytas of Tarentum called \textbf{the Flying Pigeon} which was able to fly on its own.
    As a robot is a machine which is capable of carrying out complex tasks automatically they are in different forms such as drones, humanoids, manipulator arm, etc.

    One of the major goals in Robotics is to develop autonomous robots capable perfoming and executing tedious tasks without further human intervention and it is of major practical interest in a wide variety of domains such as manufacturing, construction,space exploration, medical surgery, etc.

    However, developing the technologies necessary for autonomous robots is a formidable undertaking with deep interweaved ramifications in automated reasoning, control and perceprion, which raises many important problems, one of them which is \textbf{motion planning}, which is the major theme of this project work. This problem centrals loosely on the question ''How can a robot decide what motions to perform in order to achieve goal arrangements of physical objects?'' and this capability is paramount since by the definition of robot it accomplishes tasks by moving in real world.
    
    This work focus on the topological study of robot motion planning algorithms using results from algebraic topology and some other important areas of mathematics, and we also give pratical computational simulation of robotic manipulator using the python and C++ programming languages, the robotic operating system (ros) and Gazebo virtual robot simulator running on an Ubuntu Linux machine.
